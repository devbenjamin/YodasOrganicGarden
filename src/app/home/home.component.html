      <p>Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you something extra. Ten thousand in advance. Ten
        thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that! But who's going to fly it, kid! You? You bet I could. I'm
        not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have to sit here and listen... We haven't that much with us. But we could
        pay you two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.

        dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down
        for the night.
